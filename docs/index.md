# sendgrid Provider

> **⚠️ Unofficial Provider Notice**
> This is an **unofficial** Terraform provider for SendGrid that extends the original functionality with additional features not available in the official provider:
>
> - **Teammate Management**: Full support for `sendgrid_teammate` resource and data source
> - **Enhanced Rate Limiting**: Comprehensive rate limiting support for all resources with automatic retry on HTTP 429 errors
> - **Improved Reliability**: Built-in exponential backoff strategy for better API interaction
>
> This provider is maintained independently and is not affiliated with or officially supported by SendGrid/Twilio.

The Terraform SendGrid provider is used to interact with resources supported by SendGrid. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

## Key Features

### Rate Limiting Support

All resources include automatic retry handling for HTTP 429 "too many requests" errors with exponential backoff. This ensures reliable operation when working with the SendGrid API.

**Key features:**

- Automatic retry on HTTP 429 errors
- Exponential backoff strategy
- Configurable timeouts per resource
- Support for all SendGrid resources

For detailed information, see the [Rate Limiting Guide](rate_limiting.md).

### Teammate Management

Unlike the official provider, this version includes full support for managing SendGrid teammates:

```terraform
resource "sendgrid_teammate" "example" {
  email    = "teammate@example.com"
  is_admin = false
  scopes   = ["mail.send"]
}

data "sendgrid_teammate" "existing" {
  email = "existing@example.com"
}
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    sendgrid = {
      version = "1.0.0"
      source  = "registry.terraform.io/anna-money/sendgrid"
    }
  }
}

provider "sendgrid" {
  api_key = "SG.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
}

# Create an API key with rate limiting support
resource "sendgrid_api_key" "example" {
  name   = "example-api-key"
  scopes = ["mail.send"]
}

# Create a template
resource "sendgrid_template" "example" {
  name       = "example-template"
  generation = "dynamic"
}

# Create a teammate
resource "sendgrid_teammate" "example" {
  email    = "teammate@example.com"
  is_admin = false
  scopes   = ["mail.send"]
}
```

## Authentication

The SendGrid provider supports multiple authentication methods:

### Static credentials

```terraform

  api_key = "SG.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  host    = "https://api.sendgrid.com/v3"  # Optional
  subuser = "username"                     # Optional
}
```
