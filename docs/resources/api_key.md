# sendgrid_api_key (Resource)

Provides a SendGrid API key resource. This allows you to create, read, update, and delete SendGrid API keys.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "sendgrid_api_key" "example" {
  name   = "my-api-key"
  scopes = [
    "mail.send",
    "sender_verification_eligible",
  ]
}

# Example with custom timeouts for rate limiting
resource "sendgrid_api_key" "example_with_timeouts" {
  name   = "my-api-key-2"
  scopes = ["mail.send"]

  timeouts {
    create = "30m"
    update = "30m"
    delete = "30m"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name you will use to describe this API Key.

### Optional

- `scopes` (Set of String) The individual permissions that you are giving to this API Key.

### Read-Only

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) The API key created by the API.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Rate Limiting

This resource supports automatic retry on HTTP 429 rate limit errors. When creating multiple API keys, consider using `-parallelism=1` to avoid rate limits:

```shell
terraform apply -parallelism=1
```

For more information, see the [Rate Limiting Guide](../rate_limiting.md).

## Import

An API key can be imported using its ID:

```shell
terraform import sendgrid_api_key.example api_key_id
```
