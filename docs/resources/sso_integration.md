- `name` (String) The name of the integration.

### Optional

					This is called the 'SAML Issuer ID' in the Twilio SendGrid UI.

					and initiate an SSO login flow. This is called the 'Embed Link' in the Twilio SendGrid UI.

					If a user authenticates from their IdP, this URL will return them to their IdP when logging out.

					This is the Twilio SendGrid URL that is responsible for receiving and parsing a SAML assertion.
					This is the same URL as the Single Sign-On URL when using SendGrid.
- `completed_integration` (Boolean) Indicates if the integration is complete.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `single_signon_url` (String) The URL where your IdP should POST its SAML response.
