# sendgrid_teammate (Resource)

Manages a SendGrid teammate. Teammates are team members who have access to your SendGrid account with specific permissions.

**Important Notes:**

- Admin teammates have full access and don't need scopes
- Scopes '2fa_exempt' and '2fa_required' are set automatically by SendGrid
- Some scopes require specific SendGrid plans (Pro+, Marketing plans, etc.)
- Use timeouts for better reliability with rate limiting

## Example Usage

### Basic Teammate

```terraform
resource "sendgrid_teammate" "example" {
  email    = "teammate@example.com"
  is_admin = false
  is_sso   = false
  scopes = [
    "mail.send",
    "templates.read"
  ]
}
```

### Admin Teammate

```terraform
# Admin teammate - no scopes needed
resource "sendgrid_teammate" "admin" {
  email    = "admin@example.com"
  is_admin = true
  is_sso   = false
}
```

### SSO User

```terraform
# SSO teammate with first and last name
resource "sendgrid_teammate" "sso_user" {
  email      = "sso.user@example.com"
  first_name = "John"
  last_name  = "Doe"
  is_admin   = false
  is_sso     = true
  scopes = [
    "mail.send",
    "stats.read"
  ]
}
```

### Marketing Team Member

```terraform
# Marketing teammate with extended permissions
resource "sendgrid_teammate" "marketing" {
  email    = "marketing@example.com"
  is_admin = false
  is_sso   = false
  scopes = [
    "mail.send",
    "marketing.read",
    "marketing.automation.read",
    "templates.read",
    "templates.create",
    "templates.update",
    "stats.read"
  ]

  # Recommended: Use timeouts for better reliability
  timeouts {
    create = "30m"
    update = "30m"
    delete = "30m"
  }
}
```

### Bulk Creation

```terraform
# Bulk teammate creation using for_each
locals {
  developers = {
    "dev1" = {
      email  = "dev1@example.com"
      scopes = ["mail.send", "templates.read"]
    }
    "dev2" = {
      email  = "dev2@example.com"
      scopes = ["mail.send", "templates.read", "stats.read"]
    }
    "dev3" = {
      email  = "dev3@example.com"
      scopes = ["mail.send"]
    }
  }
}

resource "sendgrid_teammate" "developers" {
  for_each = local.developers

  email    = each.value.email
  is_admin = false
  is_sso   = false
  scopes   = each.value.scopes

  # Important: Use higher timeouts when creating multiple resources
  timeouts {
    create = "45m"
    update = "45m"
    delete = "45m"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `email` (String) The email address of the teammate. This will be used as the teammate's login.
- `is_admin` (Boolean) Whether the teammate should have admin privileges. Admin teammates have full access to the account and don't need specific scopes.

- `scopes` (Set of String) List of permission scopes for the teammate. Ignored if is_admin is true. Cannot include '2fa_exempt' or '2fa_required' as these are managed automatically by SendGrid. See SendGrid API documentation for available scopes.
- `username` (String) The username for the teammate. If not provided, the email will be used.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
